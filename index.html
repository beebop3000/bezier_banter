        <h1>A BÃ©zier curve with 5 control points</h1>
        <canvas id = "myCanvas"></canvas>

        <p>
            This is an illustration of a Bezier Curve being constructed. <br>
            There are 5 supporting points.<br>
            Each supporting point has a derived point that shuttles beteen a suporting point and its next point.<br>
            These dervived points are recursively linked to eachother.<br>
            The final derived point is used to trace the Besier Curve.<br>
            This is an interactive chart so please play with the points to get a feel for it. <br>
